    ///   - threads: The number of threads to spawn.
    ///   - runs: How many times the `subject` block should be benchmarked.
    ///   - prepareArgs: The closure that will be called before each `subject` benchmarking to prepare the argument for `subject`.

    ///   - multithreadExecutionTimeMeter: The multithread execution time meter to use for benchmarking.
    ///   - overheadAdjustment: The closure to measure the overhead adjustment of `subject` closure calls to provide more accurate results in benchmarking.
